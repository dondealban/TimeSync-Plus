# TimeSync-Plus
TimeSync+ is an application for gathering point and polygon spectral temporal information from Landsat time series data into a database.

## About 

TimeSync+ is a desktop application modeled after the original [TimeSync application](http:example.com) that was originally developed as a validation tool for the [LandTrendr](http:example.com) spectral-temporal segmentation algorimth. Since its inception, its utility has grown beyond a segmentation validation tool. It is also useful for exploring know or predicted change events on the landscape and for collecting information about individual observations in time. TimeSync-Plus better handles these two significant use cases (event and observations information collection) more explicilty and greatly expands flexibity for user to define what tpyes of information should be recorded.

### Improvements:
- Slippy map zoom and pan image chips
- Four RGB image chip display option
- Total user-control over what information can be collected
- Two new data collection modes: event and observation (original segmentation as well)
- a context map
- Modern web-like interface
- Uses Google Earth Engine to process data


## Step 1: Make a shapefile

Make a point or polygon shapefile. Either generate your own or use the [LT-ChangeDB](http:example.com) process.

Needs to have a unique ID field - needs to be noted and entered into following Earth Engine script


## Step 2: Upload the shapefile to Google Earth Engine

1. Get an EE account
2. Upload Asset 
3. 

## Step 3: Run Google Earth Engine Script to generate data

## Step 4: Run Google Earth Engine Script to generate data

## Step 5: Download data from Google Drive

## Step 6: Run Python data prep script

## Step 7: Edit App options YAML file

## Step 8: Start the App
